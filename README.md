A complex address book for singers with quickbook like features for accounting

This web-app was made for a singer singing at many different venues. It keeps track
of all the venue details like address, phone, contact-person, distance-time. It also keeps track 
of what the singer performs there, marketing material, and feedback. For example setlist, business cards, 
testimonials, and comments. This is a one stop app for all a singers managers needs. 

The app is secured with a login system.

The app has a mass email feature where you can craft a customized message that will 
be mass emailed to everyone on the mass-emailing list. 

The app has an invoice generator and can generate an invoice for a gig and it will keep 
track of it whether it has been paid or not. It logs all invoices and can be regenerated with 
the proper data. You can go to any year and pull out any old invoices.

This app will allow you to put in (green) donations & profits as well as (red) expenses and 
subscriptions. It will automatically add the mileage when the date of an invoice is reached. I created 
an easy to look at graphic user interface to see your profits vs expenses and created pages for
each of the fields of profits and expenses to make accounting much easier.
